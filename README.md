# gohan-boi
Gohan boi (ごはんボーイ) is just a lil lad who wants to help you figure out how much of each ingredient you ate in your meal so its super nice and easy to keep track of in your food tracking app of choice, even if you made a big ole' portion of soup for the whole family! Gee whiz! What a splendid lil lad! 🍚👦
